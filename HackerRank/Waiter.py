Short Problem Definition:
waiter

You are a waiter at a party. There are NN stacked plates. Each plate has a number written on it. You start picking up the plates from the top one by one and check whether the number written on the plate is divisible by a primeâ€¦.

def solveWaiter(N, Q, numbers):
    stack = []
     
    for value in numbers:
        if value % generated_primes[0] != 0:
            stack.append(value)
        else:
            print value
     
     
    for prime_idx in xrange(1, Q):
        leftover = []
         
        while stack:
            value = stack.pop()
            if value % generated_primes[prime_idx] != 0:
                leftover.append(value)
            else:
                print value
        stack = leftover
